# EVA-Project
## About
This repository contains the code and information behind EVA (**Electronic Vehicle Aid**), a project I began on **10/27/2022**. EVA was personally designed in every aspect from hardware to software to live in my 2000 Ford Mustang's head unit, with the goal of modernizing the technology in a relatively old car.
