After doing some research I've decided that making a gui entirely in python is far too heavy for my hardware, and incredibly impractical.
I'm going to continue using certain python programs like the LED lights, but I'll be shifting to a web based GUI that uses HTML, CSS, and JS, with calls to python functions.
I've yet to figure out how I'm going to call the python programs from within javascript, but I'm sure I'll be able to find a way with the scripts.
