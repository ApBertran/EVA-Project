I discovered that playing music with spotify on the gui is going to be incredibly bad, and simply all around not worth it. 
Spotify is pretty good at getting their users to strictly use their app and website, with only previews of music available in their API.
Not too much of a problem, I'm going to still be using the Sony stereo I've had in my car the whole time, will just have to move it.

After taking apart some pieces in my dash and exploring, along with getting a new double din to replace the old single din, I've made some decent progress in the fitting process.
I'm going to place the 7 inch display in the double din, I haven't thought of a way to fill in the extra space, probably just a 3D printed piece on both sides.
The stereo is going to be placed in my center vent hole, and I'll simply lose use of my center vents which I don't need.

I'll need to cut a hole in the vent tubing in order to actually fit my stereo, and I also need to see about extending the wires to reach higher up there.
If I completely cover the hole with something before it reaches the stereo I can prevent overheating and allow pressure buildup to increase the air flow in the side vents.
I've yet to figure out how I'm going to cut the vent tubing to fit the stereo, it's very difficult to reach but I'm sure it'll be doable.
