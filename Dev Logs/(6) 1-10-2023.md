After doing some research on getting music to play and be controlled by the GUI, preferably with spotify, I've learned a few things.
Most notably, it's going to be incredibly difficult but might be possible. The main problem is simply going to be getting access to my spotify playlists and being able to dynamically view them and the songs within them.
Another issue: the way I'm going to play the music is likely going to have to be through a link which means I'll need an internet connection. I'm not entirely sure how I'll be able to install music off spotify and play it as an mp3 because of spotify's encryption.
There may be a few ways to get all of this jumbled nonsense into a dynamic GUI capable of playing music off spotify with full access to my playlists, but only time and effort will tell.
