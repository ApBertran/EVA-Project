# (10/28/2022) Dev Time: 3 Hours

Received the camera today. Plugged in and got a black screen with the occasional white light. Honestly don't know what's going on with it. Going to reattempt another time.

`test_camera-rkispl.sh -> preview camera in OpenGL`

Also got monitor working, literally just needed to hit the switch on the back.

Seriously not sure how to get this camera to work. There is pretty much no documentation for this...
