# (10/24/2022) Dev Time: 1 Hour

Received the OBD2 scanner today. Plugged into the car and was able to get diagnostics. All very overwhelming, lots of info. Used a windows diagnostics software, but found something for linux.

Decided on ROCK 4 Debian for the OS. Going to put together a list of items to begin purchasing.

Will need to learn how to CAD in order to make a proper casing. Was thinking it could go on the ceiling if its flush enough, or just in the center console.

Looked at LEDs and breadboards controlled through GPIO. Should work nicely, will only slightly look like a bomb by the end of this.

Also found a nice and very small RPi camera that could be used.

Thinking of adding base features and diagnostics before working on the AI. Would like to have stuff to work with and use without being halted by the development of the AI.

Should also start thinking about what the UI will look like and where the display will even go. I still don't know at this point.

May digitize these logs in the future, to store on the Rock Pi. All previous logs will be transcribed into text files.
