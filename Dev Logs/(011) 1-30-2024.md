# (2/14/2023) Dev Time: 5 Hours

It's been almost a year since I've worked on this project, primarily because life is super busy, but also because I lacked the materials. I changed to a Raspberry Pi 4 (4gb) and it works so much better. I spent the day configuring the Pi, pulling the code from github, and making it so the application automatically booted up when the Pi turned on. With a nice mustang logo for the wallpaper, there should be a pretty cool transition into the application's GUI upon turning on the car. I think I'll have more time to work on it now, and I'm hoping to get this project to a stage where I can actually put it in my car and use it before leaving for college.

The next step is most likely to start polishing the whole thing and finally connect it to LED lights. According to my last log over 11 months ago that code seems ready, I'll just need to figure out how to make a python program communicate properly with this whole application. Shouldn't be too hard, I just need to re-immerse myself into the existing code.
