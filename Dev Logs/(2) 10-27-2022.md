WOW there's a lot going on. Tried wiring everything up and got LEDs on but there lacks full control (each color on/off and that's it) so I'm going to get a bluetooth controller and connect to the ROCK 4.

Flashed debian on a SD and got everything up and running. Runs decently quick, more than I will likely need but we'll see.

Monitor didn't turn on but I think I'll just need to install drivers on the ROCK 4.

Stuff is currently in a shoe box with nails holding things up, prototyping is rough...

I'm super excited to get working on this project, it's incredible how much work there is to be done.

Also got hotspot and phone bluetooth going, will need USB hub for more connections and bluetooth dongles, gonna be crazy.

Email and discord account made for future use.
