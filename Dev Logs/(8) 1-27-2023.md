I managed to get google maps to embed into the gui pretty nicely, haven't figured out exactly how to do step by step instructions yet but there is at least a functioning map.
I also haven't found a good way to hide my api key yet so I haven't pushed anything to github in interest of keeping it safe. 
Currently looking into making another javascript file that is called which contains only the key, but I don't know javascript well enough to get it to work at the moment.
The GUI is looking pretty promising.

I'd like to add a performance mode that's activated by a little switch in the car where it shows me diagnostics of the car rather than what music is being played. We'll see where that goes.
