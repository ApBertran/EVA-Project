I did some research on sliders in HTML/CSS/JS, and now have the lights tab showing three sliders with a box that changes color based on where the sliders are (RGB).
I haven't connected these sliders to a python file, but I've done a proof of concept about a week ago so I know it'll work, though it may need some tweaking.
Lights control seems like a pretty done deal now, I don't think I'll need to spend much more time on it from now on unless it's basic visual changes.

I'm planning on connecting it to the python LED control file soon.
