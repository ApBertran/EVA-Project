Managed to get a simple gui running on both a MacOS system and a Windows 10 system. Seems promising to be able to get it working on linux, too.
LED lights are able to be controlled from the GUI, which is surprising. There is one issue where sliding the sliders rather than tapping a location on the sliders causes the lights to jitter to seemingly random colors.
Still need to implement turning off the LEDs when pressing the off switch. You cannot control the LEDs while the switch is off, however, but it stays at its last known color which needs to change.
